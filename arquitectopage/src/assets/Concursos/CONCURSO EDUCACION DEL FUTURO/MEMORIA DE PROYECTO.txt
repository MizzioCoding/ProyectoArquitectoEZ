A circular space with concentric layers: 1. The area of tents, rest, swimming, storage and parking / 2. The space observation stands, chairs and seats / 3. The jump area/4. The pedestrian circuit / 5. The bicycle circuit/6. The central space of high friction where all leisure activities, always on wheeled carts or platforms that "convey the fun" / Three huge entrances converge in the central arena that we propose. At the end we plan to burn the man in this space. A community united in experimentation / A territory that lies between natural [the desert] and anthropised [arena] / A landscape with different scales and different way to approach that can be altered from the various movements associated with experiences / Travelers arriving from around the world to build a new map of diversity to develop in a community / The move- ment is the core of the proposal. Expressed by different speeds, ranging from quieter to vertigo.

NOMAD ARENA is a gateway to fantasy, a passage to entertain- ment where everything impossi- ble becomes reality; time seems to stop or to speed up and ev- erything changes slowly or fast giving way to a magical world.
